Right now, the near-term improvements will be:

(0) Namespace documentation, in the source code using Roxygen; as well
as other revisions that are required for Bioconductor, including a vignette.

(1) Dependencies.
For Bioconductor, dependencies will need to be explicit. This may mean
that it can only depend on packages with namespaces. Every package in 
Bioconductor has a namespace, but many packages at CRAN, including 
vegan, ape, etc., do not have namespace documentation and therefore
can only be relied-upon by fully loading them (or borrowing their 
code directly and removing the dependence).

(2) DPCoA support.

(3) Additional multiple testing features building on multtest, applied to phylogenetic sequencing data.

DONE v0.2.4+: (4)a Pipeline for certain common ordination methods applied to phyloseq data. That is, the rda.phyloseq or cca.phyloseq methods, plus their graphic representation based on 
the arguments and possibly extra parameters or features in the object.

DONE v0.2.4+: (4)b Default graphics for plot-method resulting from ordination methods.

(5) Species-network and sample-network plotting tools.
