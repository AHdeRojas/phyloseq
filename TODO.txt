The near-term improvements expected are:

(-1) Additional example data sets. Suggestions so far:
	The "human enterotype" dataset
	Soils reproducibility dataset
	Biodegradation dataset

(0) Importers for Mothur, pangea, RDP_pipeline, etc.

(1) Add extensions for running parallelized wUniFrac.

(2) DPCoA support methods.

(3) Species-network and sample-network plotting tools.

(4) Abundance table simulation / resampling tools.

(5) Quick alpha-diversity metrics summary

(6) Add alpha-diversity summary to barplots

(7) Legends for tree plots.

(8) build_phyloseq() alias of phyloseq() for illustrative purposes. phyloseq() will still
be the method, but purpose more obvious.
