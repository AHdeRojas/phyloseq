phyloseq 0.99.x
===========
* Bioconductor development release updates.
* BIOM format import: import_biom() function
* Parallel Fast UniFrac
* Several published exampled datasets included
* Directly call vegdist() on phyloseq-class object (method extension)
* General importer for all supported data formats: import()
* Lots of documentation updates.
* Lots and lots of fixes and improvements.

v0.99.24
===========
* Advanced network/graph plotting/visualization wrappers: make_sample_network(), plot_sample_network()
* Advanced alpha diversity wrappers: plot_richness_estimates(), estimate_richness()
* Added taxafilter() function for even more convenient filtering of species/taxa
* Added reshape dependency for explicit use of melt() function.

v0.99.23
===========
* Added a rooted tree to "GlobalPatterns" dataset
* Allow multi-class tests with mt()

v0.99.20
===========
* Added "GlobalPatterns" dataset, and some other minor improvements
* added "GlobalPatterns" dataset, with doc and some analysis
  examples. More examples will be added to the vignette.
* add getVariable accessor function, for streamlining access
  to values/vectors/factors/etc of the variates contained in
  the sampleData component
* revise documentation about parallelization of import_biom()
* revise documentation for enterotype dataset

v0.99.19
===========
* fixed a bug in general import() function in which it properly processed import command, but then failed to return result.

v0.99.18
===========
* Added import_biom() function to import BIOM format OTU-clustered data / metadata
* Added (direct) dependency for plyr, as well as RJSONIO 


phyloseq 0.4.2 - 0.4.7
===========

* Improvements to import_mothur() via import_mothur_otulist().
* merge_samples() function added, in preparation for hypergeometric (fisher.test) test wrapper.
* Fixed bug in merge_phyloseq() for certain combinations of objects. 
* Various other fixes and improvements.

phyloseq 0.4.1
===========

* First official submission to Bioconductor
* Includes many build-fixes, bug-fixes
* Final tweaks to conform to Bioconductor guidelines

phyloseq 0.3
===========

* Added Importers for mothur, RDP-pipeline, and PyroTagger
* Lots of new plotting and analysis support
* Parallelized UniFrac calculations using foreach package
* Some improvements to the class inheritance structure to simplify method extension and future development.
* Function-level documentation
* Vignette-level documentation
* Package dependencies achieved via import for all packages with a namespace. Depends (full load) otherwise.

phyloseq 0.2.4
===========

* Added ordination and plotting pipeline, calcplot() and plot.ordination.phyloseq()
